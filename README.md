2023 AoC repo. The goal of this repo is to produce the fastest working solutions to the 2023 Advent of Code problems from a runtime perspective. 

Solutions are in /src/solutions labelled DayXX.java for day XX (days 1-9 are left padded with a 0).

All edits to solutions should preserve correctness (i.e. same inputs should return the same outputs between the new and edited version of a solution).

For parallelism and other hardware specific purposes, the hardware the solutions are run on is a 2024 MacBook Pro, with 14 cpu cores, 20 gpu cores, and 48GB memory

All solutions should be valid Java code, and all python code in this repo is solely for orchestration and not for the solutions.
